- Set up the Django project
Start a project named 'TaskMaster', Create an app called 'tasks', Register the app, Create a simple homepage

- Build the core views and URL routing for task management
Extend on the tasks app.
Define function-based views: task_list, task_detail.
Configure URLs: /tasks/, /tasks/<int:task_id>/.

The above was what we did so far. Now we have to do the rest as follows:

- Design templates and integrate static files.
Create a base template (base.html) with Bootstrap/tailwind for consistent styling.
Build task_list.html and task_detail.html templates using Django syntax.
Add static CSS/JS files for styling and interactivity.

- Model the database structure.
Define Task and UserProfile models:
Fields: title, description, deadline, status, priority, assigned_to (ForeignKey to User).
Relationships: Many-to-many for task categories.
Run migrations and register models in the admin interface.

- Create forms for task management.
Build a TaskForm using ModelForm to create/edit tasks.
Add validation: Ensure deadlines are future dates.
Implement file uploads for task attachments.

- Add user authentication and permissions.
Enable Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system for registration/login.
Restrict task editing/deletion to assigned users or admins using decorators (e.g., @login_required).
Create an admin dashboard to manage all tasks.

Ok, so the above are the things we need to achieve in the project. 
So, in summary, the project is:
